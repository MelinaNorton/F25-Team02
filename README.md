# Driver_Incentive_Program
Senior Practicum Semester Project.
# Prompt
  Your company has been hired by an entrepreneur to build a software system for the trucking industry.
Specifically, your team has the contract to build a web application that can be used to incentivize the
improvement of the on-road performance of truck drivers. Your client wants to use the web app to sell
the incentive service to companies that work with truck drivers (referred to as sponsors below). To
encourage better driving, the sponsors (companies) are going to award points to drivers for behaviors
they want to encourage and possibly take away points for bad behaviors. The program is much like
many reward programs where you earn points for doing things the rewarder wants you to do. In this
application, the sponsors will maintain a catalog of products (think Amazon, but much smaller) where
the drivers can redeem their points. Since your entrepreneurial client has no revenue flow, your
company is working this project “on spec” for 1% of the total sales generated by the system once it
moves from development to production. [Which means you really want to know who bought what for
how much!] All of the products are sold & delivered via a third party. Your company will also be the
maintainers and administrators of the system once it goes into production.
